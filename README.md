# Stephen Calabro
## Honors Computer Science

Hi, my name is Stephen Calabro. In the past, I have completed coding projects on the website Scratch. I also coded in middle school in class, and completed multiple projects. I decided to take Computer Science Honors because coding has always interested me. I feel like there is much more to learn with computers and technology than what I already know. I feel like advancing my coding skills will make me an overall more well rounded student. Some of my other interests academically involve math and history. Outside of school, I am a competitive swimmer, and compete for GA and the aquatic club. My overall goal for this class is to leave with a positive expierence and know my way around a computer much better than I know currently.
